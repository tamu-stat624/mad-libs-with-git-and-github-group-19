Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear John,

I am writing to you from a big spaceship in a beautiful galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a red rocket in june. There are 2 cars and beaches of quicksand here! In the
hall there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a bombastic bed of
rubber and dream of football carefully. It feels as though I have lived here for
10 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
walking on a slow car!!

Best wishes,
Capt. Jack Sparrow
